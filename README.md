Five card draw is a simple poker style game. This library provides the basic functionality to play the game.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = runGame


exampleGame :: Game ()
exampleGame = do
  let player1Name = "Player 1"
      player2Name = "Player 2"

  player1 <- takeSeat $ mkPlayer player1Name 1000
  player2 <- takeSeat $ mkPlayer player2Name 1000

  -- pre draw round

  sitIn player1
  sitIn player2 
    
  postAnte player1
  postAnte player2
    
  designateDealer player1
  
  dealCards
  
  bet player1 (Chips 250)
  call player2

  endRound

  -- post draw round

  draw player1 $ DrawChoices Keep Keep Keep Discard Discard
  draw player2 $ DrawChoices Discard Discard Keep Discard Keep

  raise player1 (Chips 500)
  fold player2
  muckHand player2

  -- showdown

  endRound
